## About Me

This website is still under development, but for now, here's an introduction. My name is Anshuk, and I am a Graduate Student from the CCI department of UNCC. 
I have quite a lot of projects going on right now, along with creating this website, but one of the things I am focusing on is setting up a server to self-host 
a password manager and access it via a sub-domain. The current plan is to run a Docker image of the service vaultwarden on an old OptiPlex and then connect it to Cloudflare
using tunnels.
